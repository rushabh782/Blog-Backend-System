# Blog Backend System

## Overview

The Blog Backend System is a Node.js and Express.js powered backend platform designed to support the functionalities of a blog website. The system enables user authentication, blog post creation, and comment management. The platform utilizes MySQL as the database for storing user information, blog posts, and comments. 

This backend system serves as the backbone for a full-fledged blog platform where users can register, login, create blog posts, and leave comments on posts. The system is designed to be scalable and can be easily extended with more features, such as advanced user roles, tags for blog posts, or post categorization.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to the platform securely. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and stored securely.
- **Blog Creation**: Registered users can create blog posts. Each post includes a title, content, and the author's details.
- **Commenting System**: Users can comment on blog posts. Comments are associated with specific posts and users.
- **JWT Token Authentication**: For secure API access, JWT tokens are used to authenticate and authorize users.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building REST APIs.
